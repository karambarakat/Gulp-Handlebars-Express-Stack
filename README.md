# gulp-project

Here I put all my small html items + I build CV-like portfolio website using Gulp/Hanldebars/ExpressJS.

## Stack

For this project I used:
- HandleBars: template engine to avoid html repetition, add some components.
- Gulp: for building Handlebars
- ExpressJs

## Getting Started
First you have to build the static files using Gulp, then use simple ExpressJS code to serve these files.

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
